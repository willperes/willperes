## Summary

I’m a software engineer with 4+ years of experience building web and mobile applications across different business domains.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked on systems that support real operational workflows, including e-commerce platforms, digital wallets, credit request systems, and B2B marketplaces. I’ve contributed to high-value transaction flows, financial processes, and integrations with external services, helping businesses operate more efficiently and reliably.

My background combines strong frontend expertise in React, React Native, and Next.js with backend experience using Java (Spring) and Node.js. I’ve worked with APIs, microservices, and distributed architectures, focusing on clear design, maintainable code, and practical solutions to complex business problems.
